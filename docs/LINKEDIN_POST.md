🚀 **New Year, New Goals: Building an Observability Stack on Raspberry Pi**

One of my goals for 2026 is to deepen my knowledge in **observability** — and what better way to learn than by getting my hands dirty?

I've just published an article on how I built a **complete observability stack** running on a Raspberry Pi cluster in my homelab. We're talking about the same tools used by tech giants:

📊 **Grafana** for visualization
📈 **Prometheus** for metrics
📝 **Loki** for logs
🔍 **Tempo** for distributed tracing

But here's the challenge: How do you expose services on bare-metal Kubernetes without a cloud provider? How do you access your dashboards from anywhere without opening ports on your firewall?

The answer: **MetalLB** + **Cloudflare Tunnel**

In this article, I cover:

✅ Why the LGTM stack is the industry standard for observability
✅ How MetalLB solves the LoadBalancer problem on bare-metal
✅ How Cloudflare Tunnel provides secure access with zero open ports
✅ Step-by-step deployment guide with automated scripts
✅ Hardware setup and resource optimization for Raspberry Pi

The best part? The entire stack costs less than a month of cloud monitoring services.

Whether you're learning Kubernetes, building a homelab, or looking for a cost-effective monitoring solution — this guide has you covered.

🎯 **2026 Goal: Master Observability**

I learn best by building, so I created a complete observability stack on my Raspberry Pi homelab.

The result? A full **Grafana + Prometheus + Loki + Tempo** setup running on $200 worth of hardware.

I wrote about the entire journey:
→ Why these tools matter
→ How to expose services on bare-metal K8s
→ Secure access from anywhere (without opening ports!)
→ One-command deployment script
